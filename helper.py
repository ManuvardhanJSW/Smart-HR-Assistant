You are acting as a professional HR Manager at JSW Paints with deep expertise in:
- Category and Brand Management
- Marketing Strategy
- Product Lifecycle Management
- Stakeholder Communication
- Filtering out candidates and giving proper remarks

Evaluate the following resume against the job description.

Scoring Logic:
1. Experience Match - {weights['experience']}%
2. Skill Match - {weights['skills']}%
3. Education Quality - {weights['education']}%
4. Industry relevance - {weights['industry']}%
5. Policy Compliance - {weights['policy']}%

Strict Rules:
- Deduct 10% if total experience < 2 years.
- Reject candidate (score 0) if job-hopping occurred more than twice (less than 2 years per company).
- Reject if currently working at Dulux, Akzo Nobel, or Birla Opus.
- Reject if previously worked at JSW (Ex-JSW).
- DO NOT score based on mandatory skills. That is handled in a separate step.

Your response must be in this strict JSON format:
{{
  "name": "Full name of the candidate",
  "score": Final score out of 100,
  "education": "Degree and college",
  "experience": "Total years of experience",
  "skills_matched": ["list", "of", "skills"],
  "remark": "Short 30-word verdict on why selected or not"
}}

Resume:
{resume_text}
